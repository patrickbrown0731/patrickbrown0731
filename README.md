I build interactive, motion-first web experiences and 3D visuals. My focus is on animation systems, performant rendering, and polished UI motion using modern web tools and libraries.

## About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on: portfolio pieces and interactive demos that showcase advanced 2D & 3D animation techniques.
- 🌱 I’m learning: advanced WebGL optimizations, real-time rendering patterns, and shader workflows.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: immersive web apps, web-based visualizations, and experimental UI animation.
- 💬 Ask me about: React, Next.js, Three.js, React Three Fiber, GSAP, GLSL, animation architecture, and performance tuning.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love converting motion design concepts into reusable animation systems and components.

## Core Skills
- Frameworks & libraries: React, Next.js, React Three Fiber
- 3D & graphics: Three.js, GLSL shaders, post-processing, model pipelines
- Animation: GSAP (timelines + integrations), Framer Motion, timeline-based orchestration
- Motion systems: reusable animation primitives, state-driven motion, sequencing
- Languages & tooling: JavaScript, TypeScript, Vite, Webpack
- Testing & infra: Jest, Playwright, GitHub Actions
- Backend & data: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (when projects require fullstack)

Three.js + r3f integration pattern
- Keep heavy updates off the React render path (useFrame, refs, and memoized geometries).
- Reduce draw calls: merge geometries, use instancing, and minimize material/shader switches.
- Post-process selectively: compose effects only when they add clear value and budget them per frame.
